# RockPaperScissors
The game works like this:

* You choose how many turns you want: best out of 3 (you have to win two times) or 5 (you have to win three times).
* Then you type one of the options: rock, paper, scissors.
* The computer will randomly select one of the options.
* The first to reach the minimum number of necessary wins (either 2 or 3 depending on the number of turns you chose) wins the game overall.
